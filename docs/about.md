title: About: Chloe Lee

I am a Systems Analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in the Rotational Systems Grad program.

I graduated from Cornell University in 2019 with a major in Operations Research Engineering. During my junior year, I interned at BBH in their Fund Accounting Systems team as a front end developer and returned as a fulltime after graduation.

As part of the Rotational Systems Grad program, I was able to grow my skills in a diverse range of tools and technologies. 
Currently, for my third rotation, I joined the Cloud Engineering team in Infrastructure Strategy, where we containerize and host development projects on the cloud (on prem) as well as research and analyze different cloud providers to find the best fit for the firm. As part of this team, I mainly work with CI/CD tools (Jenkins) and assist with scheduled patch maintenance and day-to-day cloud requests from development teams. 

My previous rotations were in:
1. Private Banking - Front End (Angular), SharePoint development (SharePoint + C#)
1. Corporate Finance Technology - UI/UX Design, Front End development (Angular), BI tools (Qlik), Project Management (SDLC/Agile project planning)

Dance has always been a passion for me since highschool but ever since the quarantine it's been difficult finding enough space to dance at home :D. I also spend my free time drawing my own characters and listening to ASMR!
